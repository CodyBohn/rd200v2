# rd200v2
RadonEye RD200 Version 2 Integration for Homeasssistant

Based on: https://github.com/EtoTen/radonreader/ and the AirThings BLE Homeassistant Integration (https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/airthings_ble) and https://github.com/vincegio/airthings-ble

Only works for RD200 Version 2 units with serial number starting with FR:RU

I may add Version 1 at a later date, I think can just switch off the serial number, change the UUIDs, and change the parsing code. Feel free to submit a PR to add v1 capability. 

Plan to add Temperature and Humitidy service that was found by @valentinbarral in an ESPHome PR but never merged
